This repository contains the files required for the simulation of the 2d occupancy grid
The Folder Scripts contains 2 files
1. Final_Script.py
2. Latency_measurement.py

the first script should be run only after the successful launch of the gazebo house simulation.
the second script's functionality is only to measure the latency of the grid generation.
the yolov3.cfg and the yolov3.weights files must be present in the same directory as the final_script.py

Thank You!
